        Visited this legendary place during Business Trip , we tried there
        special paradise Mutton curry with Tandoori Roti , Followed by Mutton
        Biryani . Mutton curry was out of the world , pieces were soft ,
        perfectly cooked and had a great flavour of Curry leaf in dish. Tandoori
        breads were also good in taste .
      </p>

      <p>
        Now it was a time to witness the great flavour of World famous Biryani
        from paradise which was served with Mirchi ka salan and Raita.... But
        guys trust me it was a big disappointment , no flavours , Rice quality
        was mixed some are big grain , some were broken , Biryani Masala was
        also not good at all , even the Mutton quality. I M a big Biryani Lover
        know the basic flavours and taste , But did not satisfied with there
        world famous Biryani . Service was good . Ambience was OK.
